## What are the Features of ArchiSuite 16?
 
ArchiSuite 16 is not just a simple update of the previous version, but a complete overhaul of the software extension. It introduces a new plug-in called ArchiTools, which offers many new features and functions for Archicad users. Here are some of the highlights of ArchiTools 16:

- Real-time access to external databases: You can connect Archicad to any external database, such as Excel, Access, SQL, etc., and import or export data between them. This allows you to create dynamic and interactive projects that can be updated automatically with any changes in the database[^2^].
- Advanced object creation and editing: You can create custom objects with complex shapes and parametric properties using ArchiForma 2, a powerful tool for modeling and sculpting. You can also edit any existing object in Archicad with ArchiEdit 2, which lets you modify its geometry, attributes, materials, etc., without losing its parametric features.
- Enhanced design and presentation tools: You can design and calculate floor and ceiling coverings with ArchiTiles, which allows you to choose from different types of tiles, patterns, layouts, and materials. You can also create realistic and artistic renderings of your projects with ArchiRender 2, which integrates Artlantis Render engine into Archicad.
- Improved productivity and workflow: You can manage your time and resources more efficiently with ArchiTime, which tracks all the operations performed on your project and calculates the time spent on each one. You can also automate repetitive tasks and customize your work environment with ArchiScript 2, which lets you write and run scripts in Archicad.

These are just some of the features of ArchiSuite 16 that can help you improve your design skills and productivity with Archicad. To learn more about ArchiSuite 16 and its plug-ins, you can visit the Cigraph website or watch some tutorials on YouTube[^1^].
